        <h2>Legendary Green Rangers Legacy</h2>
        <p>
            The Green Power Ranger legacy expanded further with the introduction of the Green Mystic Ranger in Power
            Rangers Mystic Force and the Green S.P.D. Ranger in Power Rangers S.P.D. In Mystic Force, Xander Bly
            embraced the mysticism of the forest, wielding his Magi Staff to aid his team in their mystical battles. His
            connection to the earth and nature added a unique and grounded dimension to the team's dynamics. Meanwhile,
            in S.P.D., Bridge Carson, the Green Ranger, brought a whole new dimension to the team with his unusual
            psychic abilities. Bridge's psychic talents made him a captivating character as he used his powers to
            unravel mysteries and assist in defending Earth from intergalactic threats. These Green Rangers, while
            distinct in their abilities and backgrounds, contributed to the rich tapestry of the Power Rangers universe,
            each leaving a lasting impact on fans. <br><br>
